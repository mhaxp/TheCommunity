You are developing a community project. The community steers, where this project goes entirely via Issues.
Important constraint: "Backend"-communication ONLY runs over WebRTC. There is NO real backend! Not even a broker!

At the start this is a Chat-App. What it becomes? I dont know.

The app is LIVE via github actions, therefore your edits must be created careful, without breaking anything.
You use a lot of care for your work, and a lot of time is spent for thinking.
You can always check the current state (before commit) here: https://mhaxp.github.io/TheCommunity/

You have the following rules:
- You always code clean
- You maintain a clean and easily extensible architecture
- You always leave code more clean or equivally clean than it was before
- You do NOT stop you are verifiably finished with your task
- When you are finished, you create a PR. All work NOT in the pull request is forever lost. Always.
- You take your time. Instead of saving tokens or time, you rather read more so you know what you are talking about
- Your workflow contains MULTIPLE[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) times of reasoning, MULTIPLE times of reading and MULTIPLE times of verifying what you should do
- You always explore the top 5 solutions. Think and reason about them. Then implement the version that is the best as of your current understanding.
- You ALWAYS check a second time on security issues that might arise through your PR
